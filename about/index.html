    <h1>What I'm Doing</h1>
    <p>
        I am slowly making a website containing different pages that hold information from different sources 
        of fiction that are about creatures found in those wonderful worlds of imagination.
    </p>

    <h2>Eventual Pages</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Dragons</dt>
        <dd>I will have a page specifically for the different types of Dragons 
            and give information that is specific to those types of dragons.
        </dd>
        <dt>Giants</dt>
        <dd>There are multiple types of giants depending on what sources you get 
            them from. For example D&D has Storm Giants and Fire Giants while Harry 
            Potter simply has Giants and Half-Giants.
        </dd>
        <dt>Other Misc Creatures</dt>
        <dd>To name a few I am interested in eventually adding there are Basilisks, The Nemean Lion, Direwolves, 
            Goblins, Werewolves, and Elementals.
